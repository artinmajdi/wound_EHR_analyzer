A professional AI-powered tool for analyzing and interpreting wound care management data, providing healthcare professionals with advanced insights and recommendations.

<!-- [ðŸ“š View Full Documentation](docs/index.md) -->

## Overview

This application leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze wound care data, generating comprehensive insights and evidence-based recommendations for healthcare providers. The system includes both an interactive web dashboard and command-line tools for efficient data processing and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Analysis Dashboard**: Streamlit-based interface for real-time data visualization and AI-powered insights
- **Multi-Model LLM Support**: Compatible with various LLM platforms including OpenAI and custom endpoints
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis**: Comprehensive wound healing trend analysis and progression tracking
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Support for diverse data types including images, time-series data, and clinical notes
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from API interruptions and connection issues
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker support for consistent deployment across environments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- OpenAI API key or compatible service

### Installation & Setup

We provide convenient scripts for all setup operations. Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

#### Option 0: Pip Installation (Simplest Method)

```bash
# Install directly from PyPI (once published)
pip install wound-analysis

# Or install the latest version from GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/artinmajdi/Wound_management_interpreter_LLM.git

# Run the dashboard
wound-dashboard

# Or run analysis from command line
wound-analysis --record-id 41
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed pip installation instructions.

#### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# 1. Set up environment variables (API keys, etc.)
./scripts/setup_env.sh

# 2. Start the application in Docker
./scripts/run_docker.sh start

# 3. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8501
```

#### Option 2: Conda Environment (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# 1. Create and configure the conda environment
./scripts/setup_conda.sh

# 2. Activate the environment
conda activate wound_analysis

# 3. Run the dashboard
streamlit run wound_analysis/dashboard.py
```

#### Option 3: Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies and set up environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
./scripts/setup_env.sh

# 3. Run the dashboard
streamlit run wound_analysis/dashboard.py
```
